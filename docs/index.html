<p>Artificial intelligence is driving one of the most important revolutions in organic chemistry. Multiple platforms, including tools for reaction prediction and synthesis planning based on machine learning, successfully became part of the organic chemists’ daily laboratory, assisting in domain-specific synthetic problems. Unlike reaction prediction and retrosynthetic models, reaction yields models have been less investigated, despite the enormous potential of accurately predicting them. Reaction yields models, describing the percentage of the reactants that is converted to the desired products, could guide chemists and help them select high-yielding reactions and score synthesis routes, reducing the number of attempts. So far, yield predictions have been predominantly performed for high-throughput experiments using a categorical (one-hot) encoding of reactants, concatenated molecular fingerprints, or computed chemical descriptors. Here, we extend the application of natural language processing architectures to predict reaction properties given a text-based representation of the reaction, using an encoder transformer model combined with a regression layer. We demonstrate outstanding prediction performance on two high-throughput experiment reactions sets. An analysis of the yields reported in the open-source USPTO data set shows that their distribution differs depending on the mass scale, limiting the dataset applicability in reaction yields predictions.</p>
<p>This repository complements our study on predicting chemical reaction yields, which can currently be found on <a href="https://chemrxiv.org/articles/preprint/Prediction_of_Chemical_Reaction_Yields_using_Deep_Learning/12758474">ChemRxiv</a>.</p>

<p>Transformer models have recently revolutionised Natural Language Processing and were also successfully applied to task in chemistry, using a text-based representation of molecules and chemical reactions called Simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES).</p>

<p>Those studies show that Transformer models are able to learn organic chemistry and chemical reactions from SMILES.</p>
<p>Here we asked the question, how well a <strong>BERT</strong> model would perform when applied to a <strong>yield prediction</strong> task:</p>

{% include image.html max-width="800" file="/rxn_yields/images/pipeline.jpg" %}
<p style="text-align: center;"> <b>Figure:</b> Pipeline and task description. </p>
</div><p>To do so, we started with the reaction fingerprint models from the <a href="https://rxn4chemistry.github.io/rxnfp/">rxnfp</a> library and added a fine-tuning regression head through <a href="https://simpletransformers.ai">SimpleTransformers.ai</a>. As we don't need to change the hyperparameters of the base model, we only tune the learning rate for the training and the dropout probability.</p>
<p>We explored two high-throughput experiment (HTE) data sets and then also the yields data found in the USPTO data base.</p>

Here, we show competitive results starting simply from a text-based reaction SMILES input to our models.</p>

There are numerous reasons why yield data in patents is noisy. Therefore, it the data set is not ideal for a yield prediction task. Using Reaction Atlases, made with the tutorial shown in <a href="https://rxn4chemistry.github.io/rxnfp/">rxnfp</a>, we show that while general yield trends exists. The local reaction neighbourhoods are very noisy and better quality data would be required.</p>

</div><p>We performed different experiments using random and time splits on the reaction data. As a sanity check, we compared the results to the one where we randomise the yields of the reactions. In one of the experiments, we smoothed the yield data taking the average of twice its own yield plus the yields of the three nearest-neighbours. This procedure could potentially improve the data set quality by smoothing out originating from (human) errors. Accordingly, the results of the Yield-BERT on the smoothed data set are better than on the original yields.</p>
